# Rationale:
#   - Build only master and tags
#   - Master is the most current not yet released state
#   - Tags are the only mean to release a version
#   - If tag matches the latest version configured here, the floating tag
#     `:latest` will be conferred to this particular image.
#   - PR are being built and tested, but not published
#   - Concurrency is disabled; Newer jobs superseding older ones
#   - To share image between stages the intermediate product will be taged with
#     `:ci-$variant` and pushed to docker hub
